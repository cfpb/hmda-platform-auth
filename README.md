# HMDA Platform Auth
This project provides [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/)-based
authentication and authorization services for all HMDA APIs and web applications 
with identity requirements.  This currently includes the
[`hmda-platform`](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform) and 
[`hmda-platform-ui`](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform-ui) projects,
though may support more in the future.

## Technologies

* [Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org/) - Open-source identity management, with full OpenID Connect support.
* [mod_auth_openidc](https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc) - Open-source OpenID Connect authentication and authorization proxy.

## Dependencies
This project has been fully Docker-ized.  Docker is all you need to launch the full stack!

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation
This project is intended to be run from [`hmda-platform`](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform)'s
Docker Compose setup, configured in [`hmda-platform/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).
Please see [the instructions in that repo](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform#to-run-the-entire-platform)
for details on how to launch the system.

## Config

### Automated
The Keycloak Docker image comes with the default "master" (admin) realm, and a "hmda" realm configured 
for integrating with the oidc-client webapp.  If you want to persist changes to "hmda", edit 
`keycloak/import/hmda-realm.json`.  This file is copied in during the Docker built, and applied to 
Keycloak via its [Import/Export](https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/server_admin/topics/export-import.html)
functionality.

### Manual

## Use it!
Once you've jumped through all of these setup hoops, you're ready to authenticate.

### Integrate your own app
When integrating with your own app, the following are the most important configs.
Defaults should work for the rest of the usual OIDC settings.

* **Discovery Endpoint:** https://192.168.99.100:8443/auth/realms/hmda/.well-known/openid-configuration
* **Client ID:** hmda-api

### Services
The following services are included in the Docker Compose config.

#### Keycloak
Keycloak acts as an OpenID Connect Identity Provider.  It is available at:

* https://192.168.99.100:8443/auth/

#### Auth Proxy
Secure API Gateway protecting HMDA APIs with auth requirements

* https://192.168.99.100:4443 - Auth Proxy Status
* https://192.168.99.100:4443/hmda/ - Protected HMDA Filing API

#### Email
Several of Keycloak's identity manangement workflows involve email confirmation.
In order to test this locally, we've included the [MailDev](http://danfarrelly.nyc/MailDev/)
service.  All emails sent by Keycloak can be viewed at:

* https://192.168.99.100:8443/mail/
